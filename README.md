.irssi
======

This is my configuration for Irssi, the client of the future:
http://www.irssi.org/

To use it, clone the repository to your home directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ncortot/dot-irssi.git ~/.irssi
```

Then edit `~/.irssi/config` to your needs. Important settings that you should
change are marked with `# TODO`.
